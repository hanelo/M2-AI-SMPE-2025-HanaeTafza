📘 Description of Each Folder
🟦 CI computation/
Contains the notebook and results for computing independent confidence intervals
on the performance measurements (execution time).

🟧 Challenger/
Contains the analysis of the Challenger O-ring dataset from the MOOC on reproducible research.

🟩 Good Graphics/
Contains critiques of misleading or poorly designed figures, following the
official SMPE Good Graphics checklist, plus improved redesign proposals.

🟨 HW2_parallel_quicksort/
Contains:

experiment scripts

raw & processed data

quicksort_analysis.ipynb

experiment design

final report

This is the main performance evaluation project.

🟪 peer evaluation/
Contains your computational document for MOOC Module 3 (e.g. weekly CO₂ dataset):

notebook (.ipynb)

exported .pdf
