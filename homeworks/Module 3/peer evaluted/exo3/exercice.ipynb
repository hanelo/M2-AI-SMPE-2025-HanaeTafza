    "\n",
    "1. **Superposition of components**: The raw time series shows a clear combination of a **seasonal oscillation** and a **slow, systematic increase**.\n",
    "2. **Separation of phenomena**: Using seasonal decomposition (additive model, period = 52 weeks), we separated the series into **trend**, **seasonal**, and **residual** components.\n",
    "3. **Seasonal characterization**: The seasonal component has an amplitude of a few ppm and shows a regular annual cycle: CO₂ peaks in late spring and is lowest in late summer, reflecting the terrestrial carbon cycle in the Northern Hemisphere.\n",
    "4. **Trend modeling**: We fitted a **simple linear model** to the decomposed trend. The slope corresponds to the average annual increase in CO₂ concentration.\n",
    "5. **Extrapolation to 2025**: We extrapolated the linear model to 2025, providing a simple forecast of future CO₂ levels. This can be used as a baseline to compare with future observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise illustrates how time series analysis can separate and characterize different components of a signal and how simple models can be used for trend estimation and extrapolation, while keeping in mind their limitations in a complex system such as the Earth's climate."
