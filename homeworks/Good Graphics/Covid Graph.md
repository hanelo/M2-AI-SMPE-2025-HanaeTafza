(First COVID graph)



2. Checklist-Based Issues (from the official checklist)

Using the rules in 

02_Check-list-good-graphics-tab…



Data

✘ No confidence intervals shown.

✘ Only smoothed trend; raw variability removed → hides uncertainty.

Graphical Objects

✔ Colors distinguish curves, acceptable.

✘ Y-axis uses large empty space above 200 → wasted vertical range.

✘ Both curves overlap heavily → difficult to compare after April.

Annotations

✔ Title exists.

✔ Axis labels are correct.

✘ Date axis rotated, labels dense → harder to read.

✘ Country labels placed at the curve ends → risk of misreading.

Information

✔ Only 2 curves → good.

✘ Vertical axis not explained (7-day average).

✔ Purpose clear: compare UK vs Germany.

Context

✔ Source clearly cited.

✔ Meaning of metric included.

✘ Title could be more explicit (“7-day rolling average”).

3. Table of Problems
Issue Category	Problem	Why it’s a problem
Axis range	Too much empty space above 200	Reduces readability and resolution
Overlap	Curves overlap heavily	Hard to interpret divergence/convergence
Labels	Country names at curve ends	Risk of ambiguity and overlap
Time axis	Dense tick labels	Reduces readability
Missing CI	No variability shown	Suggests false precision
4. Proposed Improved “Hand-Drawn” Design (Text Description)

Improvements:

Two separate panels (faceted plot): one for UK, one for Germany → avoids overlap.

Full y-axis range tightened (e.g., 0–250).

Country labels moved to legend, not floating.

Monthly ticks only, horizontal labels.

Confidence ribbons added (semi-transparent bands).

Clear title: “7-day Rolling Average of New COVID-19 Cases per Million – UK vs Germany”.

This passes almost every checkpoint in the official checklist.

5. Conclusion

The original plot is visually clean but suffers from overlap, missing uncertainty, and suboptimal scaling.
The improved version enhances readability, separation, and interpretability.
