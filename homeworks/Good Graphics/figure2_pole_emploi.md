Checklist-Based Issues (from the official checklist)
Data

✔ Time series → line plot appropriate.

✘ No confidence intervals.

✘ Double dataset with two scales not justified.

Graphical Objects

✔ Good differentiation via colors.

✘ Legend icons very small.

✘ Grey UI icons (“voir tous”, zoom icon) pollute the visual.

Annotations

✔ Title present.

✘ Overly long title, redundant.

✘ X-axis lacks precise tick spacing.

✘ No clear units for Y axis (people? thousands?).

Information

✘ Scale inflation: y-axis does not start at zero → exaggerates trends.

✘ Significant white space on right side.

✘ Unclear if both curves belong in the same graph.

3. Table of Problems
Category	Problem	Explanation
UI noise	Zoom icon, grey bar	Distracts from the data
Y-axis	Not labeled clearly	Ambiguous scale
Title	Too long	Hard to read, redundant information
Scale	Axis not starting at 0	Exaggerates change
Spacing	Large blank region	Wastes space, reduces readability
4. Proposed Improved “Hand-Drawn” Design (Text Description)

A cleaner plot would:

Remove all UI elements (zoom icon, grey bar, extra empty area).

Use a standard y-axis starting at 0.

Show only 1–2 tick labels per year.

Use larger, more readable legend placed below the chart.

Optional: Use separate small multiples (facet grid): Category A vs ABC.

This passes the checklist: clear axes, clean design, no unnecessary objects.

5. Conclusion

The original figure mixes UI elements, uses unclear scales, and presents overcrowded annotations.
A simplified, structured graph greatly improves readability and message clarity
