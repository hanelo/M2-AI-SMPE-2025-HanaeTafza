juvenile_arrests's graph

✘ Serious violation: dual y-axis → classic cause of misinterpretation.

✘ Curves have different scales → visual correlation is misleading.

✘ Data frequency unclear (yearly? monthly?).

Graphical Objects

✘ Lines overly smoothed → suggests nonexistent peaks/valleys.

✔ Color differentiation acceptable.

✘ Points and lines mix inconsistently.

Annotations

✘ Y-axis on right not clearly linked to correct curve.

✘ No units for the right axis.

✘ Title too vague (“Arrests”, “Deaths”).

Information

✘ Graph suggests correlation between unrelated variables.

✘ Number of curves too high for two different scales.

✔ Time axis OK.

3. Table of Problems
Issue	Description	Why it’s a problem
Dual axes	Two Y-scales	Creates false correlation
Over-smoothing	Curves appear wavy	Misleading interpretation
Missing units	Right axis has no unit	Ambiguous values
Unrelated variables	Arrests vs child deaths	Should not be plotted together
Symbol inconsistency	Points + smoothed lines	Visual noise
4. Proposed Improved “Hand-Drawn” Design (Text Description)

A correct redesign:

 we should  NOT plot these two datasets on the same figure.

 we have to Use two separate small charts, each with its own scale.

Or use a scatterplot only if testing correlation — but these variables are unrelated.

 and to Use a straight line segments, not smoothed curves.

should provide units and clarify the dataset source.

This respects the checklist rules about avoiding dual axes and misleading comparisons.

5. Conclusion

This original figure is a classic example of misleading visualization due to dual axes and forced correlation.
A corrected version should use separate plots and avoid smoothing.
